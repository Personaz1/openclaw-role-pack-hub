# OpenClaw Role Pack Hub

A curated collection of production-ready role packs for OpenClaw workflows.

## Why
Most users need ready-to-use role packs, not raw prompt engineering from scratch.

## What is a role pack
A role pack is a reusable set of role prompts for a domain, e.g.:
- startup
- growth
- security
- support
- research

## Planned MVP
- Standard role-pack format
- Validation script
- Installer helper for local OpenClaw setups
- Community submissions via PR templates

## Goal
Make role-based automation plug-and-play.

## Status
Scaffold released. Seeking contributors.
